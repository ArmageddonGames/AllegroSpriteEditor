GFLI
----

This is the second version of my FLI plugin for "The GIMP". It now adds
saving, and the fli load/save functions are separated from the GIMP
interface, to allow them to be reused for other projects.

The saving supports currently only BRUN and LC chunks. LC2 chunks may
be added in the future. You should make a backup as an animated GIF if
possible, because saving is not tested very much.

gfli.c: Gimp wrapper for fli.c
fli.c: functions to load/save FLI movies

Please write me about your experiences with this plug-in:

This is another idea I had recently:
The FLI format allows to add chunks with new data to a frame, that are
skipped by readers that don't understand them. 
They will require a special reader. This is easy to write, because all the
fli handling is in "fli.c", and can be reused for other programs.
- MIDI events: Background musik ! (I'd need to recycle some code from
"playmidi" and "timidity")
- Text events (subtitles)
- CD-Audio synchronisation
- Trigger playback of external PCM files (digitized speech)

Known limitations:
- The FLI format allows to change the palette from frame to frame. This does
not work in Gimp, because Gimp allows only one palette per image. I'd have
to translate the image to True-Color while loading.
- Animations consume a lot of memory and swapping will slow the playback 
down.
