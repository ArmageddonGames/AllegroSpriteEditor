   An object to safely lock and unlock mutexes.

   The constructor of ScopedLock locks the mutex, the destructor
   unlocks the mutex. In this way you can safely use ScopedLock
   inside a try/catch block without worrying about to the lock
   state of the mutex.

   For example:
   @code
   try {
     ScopedLock hold(mutex);
     throw Exception();
   }
   catch (...) {
     // the mutex is unlocked here
   }
   // if you don't throw a exception, the mutex is unlocked here too
   @endcode
