# AllegroSpriteEditor

ASE is a program specially designed with facilities to create animated sprites that can be used in some video game. This program let you create from static images, to characters with movement, textures, patterns, backgrounds, logos, color palettes, and any other thing that you think.

**Created By:** David Capello	

This version of ASE is for ``Allegro 4``, anf future builds of it via this fork will continue to be for **Allegro 4.xx**.
Mr. Capello has gratiously provided us at AGN with the AG4-compatible source, project files, build tools/chain, and binaries for ou use under the GPL, 

# Scope
We plan to build a new utility based on ``AES`` either as a stanndalone tool for ZQuest (https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic), or to integrate the caoabilities of AES for Allegro 4 into the Quest Editor software.

# Support
Mr. Capello will *not support* these outdated versions, nor any spinoff versions of his software that we create based on this code.

Therefore, we kindly ask that you do not contact him for either tecnhical support, or for end-user support versions of our AG4 builds of his fantastic software.

*Instead*, please see his website at https://www.aseprite.org/ for current versions of his software, and condider supportting him through purchasing or building that for your game software graphics needs. 
( The current version of AES does ***not*** use Allegro 4.)
