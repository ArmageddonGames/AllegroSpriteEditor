# AllegroSpriteEditotr

ASE is a program specially designed with facilities to create animated sprites that can be used in some video game. This program let you create from static images, to characters with movement, textures, patterns, backgrounds, logos, color palettes, and any other thing that you think.

``Created By:`` David Capello	

This version of ASE is for ``Allegro 4``, anf future builds of it via this fork will continue to be for ``Allegro 4.xx`.
Mr. Capello has gratiously provided us at AGN with the AG4-compatible source, project files, build tooks, and binaries for ou use under the GPL, but he will not support these versions, or any spinoff versions of his software that we create, and we kindly ask that you do not contact him for either tecnhical support, or for end-user support versions of our AG4 builds of his fantastic software.

Instead, please see his website at https://www.aseprite.org/ for current versions of his software, and support him through purchasing or building that. (The current version of AES does ```not``` use Allegro 4.)
