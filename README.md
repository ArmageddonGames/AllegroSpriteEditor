# AllegroSpriteEditor

ASE is a programme specially designed with facilities to create animated sprites that can be used in video games built using the `Allegro 4 Library`. This programme assists you to create, from static images, to characters with movement, textures, patterns, backgrounds, logos, color palettes, and any other thing that you need for game graphics.

This version of ASE is for ``Allegro 4``, anf future builds of it via this fork will continue to be for **Allegro 4.xx**.
 Mr. Capello has gratiously provided  AGN with the AG4-compatible source, project files, build tools/chain, and binaries for our use under the GPL, 

# Scope
We plan to build a new utility based on ``AES`` either as a stanndalone tool for ZQuest (https://github.com/ArmageddonGames/ZeldaClassic), or to integrate the caoabilities of AES for Allegro 4 into the Quest Editor software.

# Support
Mr. Capello will *not support* these outdated versions, nor any spinoff versions of his software that we create based on this code.

Therefore, we kindly ask that you do not contact him for either tecnhical support, or for end-user support for __any versions of our AG4 builds__ of his fantastic software.

*Instead*, please see his website at https://www.aseprite.org/ for current versions of his software, and condider supportting him through purchasing or building/using that for your (`non-ZC1) game software graphics needs. 
( The current version of AES does ***not*** use Allegro 4.)
